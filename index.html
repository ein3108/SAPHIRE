<!--
<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<p>
Ubiquitous Accessible Home aims to provide an intelligent household that understands your voice command, gestures, and eye movements to open the door, turn down the heating or air-conditioning, change the lighting, start a vacuum, fill-up a bathtub, and more! This smart system will expand your control, seamlessly integrate your voice and motion commands with your house, making it smarter, cozier, and more efficient.

<!--
<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

By utilizing Microsoft Kinect2 to analyze user gestures, Google Glass to understand voice command, and an eye-tracker to recognize eye movements, Ubiquitous Accessible Home presents a model house that comprehends qualitatively different multi-modal inputs to control many household sub-systems such as heating, air-conditioning, cleaning, and more. 
In comparsion with other systems, Ubiquitous Accessible Home allows user control of different forms to make a more accessible smart home.
Users may lack the ability of giving commands in one or another form. For example, a
sign-language speaker may or may not be able to give voice commands, or prefer using sign-language to any other form of commands. In this case, Ubiquitous Accessible Home's sign-language/gesture recognition system or eye movement tracking system can serve the user's needs properly.
Ubiquitous Accessible Home's control system then sends the translated commands to a model house, executing different controls in the virtual model space. This virtual house model is our proof of concept.

<a id="project-features" class="anchor" href="#project-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Features</h3>

<!--
<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
-->
<p>
Ubiquitous Accessible Home provides three sub-translation systems that understand user's gestures, voice commands, and eye movement, respectively.
It also provides a control hub system with a developer's API that can be utilized for injecting the translated commands into smart home interface such as Nest.
